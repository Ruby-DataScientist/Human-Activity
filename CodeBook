The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps in data cleaning process :

1. Download the data set : 
	Dataset is downloaded and stored in folder "UCI HAR Dataset".
2. Reading the files :
	All required files are read and stored in the variables as :
	-- Read Features and activities 
	features <-features.txt( Rows : 561, Columns: 2)
	activity_labels <- activity_labels.txt(Rows : 6, Columns : 2)

	-- Read Training Data
	subject_train <- subject_train.txt(Rows : 2947, Columns : 1)
	x_train <- X_train.txt( Rows : 7352, Columns : 561)
	y_train <- y_train.txt(Rows : 7352, Column : 1)

	-- Read Testing Data
	subject_test <- subject_test.txt(Rows : 2947, Column : 1)
	x_test <- X_test.txt(Rows : 2947, Columns : 561)
	y_test <- y_test.txt( Rows : 2947, Column : 1)

3. Merge training and testing data : Each of the data variables of train is bound with rows to test, then subject, X and Y are column bound by columns to produce 	merged_data.

 	subject<-rbind(subject_train, subject_test)  (Rows : 10299, Column : 1)
	X<-rbind(x_train, x_test)	             (Rows : 10299, Columns: 561)
	Y<-rbind(y_train, y_test)		     (Rows : 10299, Column : 1)
	merged_data<-cbind(subject X, Y)	     (Rows : 10299, Column : 563)

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	final_clean_data(Rows: 10299, Columns :88)

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	code numbers(code) in final_clean_data are replaced with descriptive names given in corrsponding second column in activity_labels variable.
	
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	code column in final_tidy_data renamed to "activity"
	"-mean()" changed to "Mean"
	"-std()" changed to "STD"
	"Acc" chaned to "Accelerometer"
	"Gyro" changed to "Gyroscope"
	"BodyBody" changed to "Body"
	"Mag" changed to "Body"
	all starting with "t" changed to "Time"
	all starting with "f" changed to "Frequency"
	"tbody" changed to "BodyTime"
	"-freq()" changed to "Frequency"
	"angle" changed to "Angle"
	"gravity" changed to "Gravity"
  
7. From the data set in step 4(previous step), creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	Final_Independent_Dataset : is created by grouping the activities and subject and taking the average.

	Final_Independent_Data(Rows : 180 , Columns : 88)

8. Writing the results in text file : "TidyDataSet.txt"
